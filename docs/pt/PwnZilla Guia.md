# PwnZilla
## üìå Overview
This project documents my journey of setting up and customizing a Pwnagotchi from scratch.

The Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based ‚ÄúAI‚Äù powered by Bettercap. It learns from its surrounding WiFi environment to maximize the collection of crackable WPA key material. This can include material captured via passive sniffing or through deauthentication and association attacks.

Originally created by EvilSocket, the project wasn't actively maintained for a while, but it was later picked up and continued by Jayofelony. For more up-to-date information, you can refer to both the [new website](https://pwnagotchi.org) and the [original one](https://pwnagotchi.ai).

I‚Äôll be using Jayofelony's image (v2.8.9), 64-bit, as I‚Äôm working with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. If you‚Äôre using different hardware, you can check the available images and choose the one that matches your setup.

I‚Äôve chosen to use jayofelony‚Äôs v2.8.9 image because the AI feature was removed in the later release.

For this setup, I‚Äôll be using Windows as my main operating system, along with PuTTY for SSH access and 7-Zip to extract the image file. Additionally, I‚Äôll need RNDIS drivers, which can be downloaded from ModCloud [here](https://modclouddownloadprod.blob.corwindows.net/shared/mod-rndis-driver-windows.zip)

If you‚Äôre looking for a deeper explanation of how the Pwnagotchi works, feel free to check out [in depth info](../docs/HOW_IT_WORKS.md).
