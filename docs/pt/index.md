**JoÃ£o â€“ tech enthusiast, breaker of things, occasional fixer**  

Hey, my name is JoÃ£o and Iâ€™m a **tech enthusiast** who loves breaking things, not always fixing them, and sometimes learning along the way. Iâ€™m currently a student, so between classes and life, I try to spend time diving into **cybersecurity**, tinkering with **electronics** and playing video games.  

This repo is basically my **personal brain dump**, where I document my projects, things Iâ€™m learning, and random experiments.  

ðŸš§ *Still a work in progress... updates will come whenever I get around to it!* ðŸ˜†
