# Self-Hosting Vaultwarden on Raspberry Pi Zero 2
## Why?
Many people use simple or reused passwords for online services because they are easier to remember. While I used to do the same, I realized that storing passwords in web browsers is neither secure nor advisable.

To improve my security, I decided to set up a self-hosted password manager using **Vaultwarden**. 

Vaultwarden is a lightweight, self-hosted alternative to Bitwarden. It provides the same functionality while being optimized for low-resource devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. It also offers features like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), backups, SSL encryption, and remote access, ensuring better security while giving me full control over my credentials.

To achieve this, I used the following **hardware**:

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**, compact and low-power makes it ideal for self-hosted applications.
- **Waveshare 2.13 inch e-paper HAT v4**
- **MicroSD card** with 32Gb
- **Card reader**
- **Windows PC**

## Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)

The first step was to flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** onto the microSD card. I used the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) tool to complete this process.

1. Insert the microSD card into the **card reader**.
2. Open **Raspberry Pi Imager** and **Choose OS** > **Raspberry Pi OS (Other)** > **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)**.
3. Choose the microSD card as the storage device.
4. Click **Next**, then **Edit Settings** to configure: 
Enable **Set hostname**, set up a **username and password**, **Configure Wireless LAN** and  Enable **SSH** to allow remote access.

Enabling SSH allows remote access and control over the Raspberry Pi from another device. Since the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W often runs headless (without a monitor or keyboard), SSH provides a convenient way to configure and manage the system over the network.

5. **Save** and click **Yes** to use the settings, then wait to **write**.

## Connect Over SSH

Since SSH was enabled at the time of writing the OS, I can now connect to the Raspberry Pi over SSH using [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/):

1. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
2. Open **PuTTY** on my Windows PC.
3. Enter the Raspberry Pi's **IP address** (found via **nmap**) in the **Host Name (or IP address)** field.
4. Ensure the **Port** is set to `22` and **Connection type** is **SSH**.
5. Click **Open** to initiate the connection.
6. When prompted, enter the **username** and **password** set during configuration.

## On the terminal

To make sure everything runs smoothly, I started by updating and upgrading the software packages:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

### Install Docker and Portainer

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/): ``curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh``
2. Grant Docker permissions to my user (joaof): ``sudo usermod -aG docker joaof``
3. Rebooted the system for changes to take effect.: ``sudo reboot``
4. Although Docker containers can be managed via the command line, Portainer provides a user-friendly GUI interface for deploying and managing our Docker containers on Raspberry Pi. To pull the latest version of Portainer from Docker Hub: ``sudo docker pull portainer/portainer-ce:latest``
5. Creating and running a Portainer container. This command exposes the Portainer web interface on port 9000 and ensures Portainer is always restarted if the system reboots.
```
sudo docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --restart=always --name=portainer -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```
6. With the container running, opened then web browser and accessed the Portainer UI with: ``http://192.168.1.228:9000``.

### Install and Set Up Vaultwarden 
 
 After creating a Portainer account, I'll deploy and set up a self-hosted Vaultwarden server on the Pi.

 1. Click on **Volume** > **Add Volume**
 2. Created a volume named VaultwardenServer
 3. **Containers** > **Add Container** and did the following:
    - Name: Vaultwarden
    - Image: vaultwarden/server:1.32.0 (latest was not working) 
    - Map an additional port, forwarding 8080 on the host to 80 in the container.
    - **Volumes** > **Map additional volume** with ``/data`` in the container field and the ``VaultwardenServer``volume created before
    - Under Restart Policy selected ``Always``
    - Finally, click **Deploy the container** and after a few minutes,
     the Vaultwarden server is displayed as healthy in the Portainer UI
4. I can now visit ``http://192.168.1.228:8080`` Which opens the Vaultwarden web UI.

### Set Up the reverse proxy

To access and use Vaultwarden, I need to set up a reverse proxy. For this I'll be using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/).

1. Ran the following command to pull the latest nginx image and start the container:
```
sudo docker run -d \
  --name=nginx-proxy-manager \
  -p 81:81 \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v /srv/dev-disk-by-label-Backup/Docker/nginx-proxy-manager/data:/data \
  -v /srv/dev-disk-by-label-Backup/Docker/nginx-proxy-manager/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest
```
2. To check if the container starts successfully, I opened **Portainer** 
and verified that the `nginx-proxy-manager` container was running. Another way would be to run:  `docker ps -a`.

    If the container wasnâ€™t running, check the logs troubleshooting with:  ``docker logs nginx-proxy-manager``.

3. With the container up I can access the Nginx Proxy Manager web UI at
 ``http://192.168.1.228:81``.

### Securing Vaultwarden with HTTPS Using Letâ€™s Encrypt & DuckDNS  

Now that the reverse proxy is set up, I need to secure access
 to Vaultwarden with HTTPS. I'll use **DuckDNS** for dynamic DNS,
  and **Letâ€™s Encrypt** to generate a free SSL certificate.  

This will allow me to access Vaultwarden securely from anywhere
 without relying on a static IP or a paid domain.

#### Set Up DuckDNS  
1. Visited [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) and created an account.  
2. Added a new **subdomain** chaveman.duckdns.org and
 linked it to my **IPv4 address**.  
 3. Copied my **DuckDNS Token** from the page (I'll need it later).

#### Generate an SSL Certificate Using Let's Encrypt  

1. Used **Certbot** with the **DNS-01 challenge** to obtain an SSL certificate
 for my DuckDNS domain:  
Ran the following command to request a certificate using the **DNS-01 challenge**:  

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install certbot -y
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d chaveman.duckdns.org
```
2. Certbot provided a TXT record that needs to be added to DNS for verification.
Using DuckDNS's update URL:
``https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=chaveman&token=MY_TOKEN&txt=TXTVALUE&verbose=true``
i got an **OK** and this means DuckDNS set my TXT record.
3. To make sure that the TXT Record was Published waited a couple of minutes for
DNS to propagate and using Google Admin Toolbox (Dig) I could see my
 TXT Value value under the ANSWER section so we're good to go.
4. Pressed Enter and Certbot created two cert files ``fullchain.pem`` and
``privkey.pem`` in ``/etc/letsencrypt/live/Vaultwarden.duckdns.org/``.
5. ``sudo certbot certificates`` to check the certificates expirity date,
 was 90 days so to make it automaticaly renew: ``sudo crontab -e``
to open the crontab file with NANO and added the cron job ``0 0 * * * certbot renew --quiet`` which will run Certbot command to renew the SSL certificates automatically, ensuring the website's encryption remains valid without manual intervention.


#### Nginx Proxy Manager

Since the Web UIâ€™s file explorer only shows local files, I had to copy the cert files from the Raspberry Pi to my local machine so they could be uploaded.

1. Copy the cert files to my local machine using ``scp`` (secure copy):
```bash
  scp joaof@192.168.1.228:/etc/letsencrypt/live/Vaultwarden.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem /home/joaof/Documents/Certificates
  scp joaof@192.168.1.228:/etc/letsencrypt/live/Vaultwarden.duckdns.org/privkey.pem /home/joaof/Documents/Certificates
```
2. Returned to the **Nginx Proxy Manager Web UI** > **SSL Certificates** > 
**Add SSL Certificate** > **Custom** and selected the cert files:
![certificates](images/SSL_Certificate.png)
3. **Add Proxy Host**:
![addproxyhost](images/ProxyHost.png)
4. Under **SSL**:
![ssl](images/SSLProxyHost.png)


At this point I should've been able to connect to https://chaveman.duckdns.org but i was getting
an SSL error on the browser and using [Port Checker](https://portchecker.co/) I can see that my ISP is blocking inbound traffic for port 443.

5. Access my router configurations to port forward the 443 port to the rpi.
6. Finally connect to [https://chaveman.duckdns.org](https://chaveman.duckdns.org) and access Vaultwarden.


### Enhancing Vaultwarden with an E-Paper Display

1. Enabled SPI on my Raspberry Pi by running:
``sudo raspi-config``
2. Navigated to **Interfacing Options** > **SPI** > **Enable**
3. After enabling SPI, I rebooted the system: ``sudo reboot``
4. Installing the necessary Python libraries:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-pil python3-numpy
sudo apt-get install python3-spidev python3-rpi.gpio
sudo apt-get install python3-psutil
```
5. Cloned the [waveshareteam repo](https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper/) and moved into the correct directory: 
```
git clone https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper.git
cd ~/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python
```
6. For the Waveshare 2.13-inch v4 display, I used the ``epd2in13_V4`` module from ``../lib/waveshare_epd`` and tested it using ``../examples/epd2in13_V4_test.py``.
From there, I built [system_monitor_v1](system_monitor_v1.txt) to display system info like temperature, uptime, and IP address.
